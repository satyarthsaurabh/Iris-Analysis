# Iris-Analysis:
It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

1. Id
2. SepalLengthCm.
3. SepalWidthCm.
4. PetalLengthCm.
5. PetalWidthCm.
6. Species

EDA of the Iris dataset using python.
Plotting the plot such as pair-plot, scatter plot to get the information:
 1. Using sepal_length and sepal_width we can distinguish Setosa flower from others.
 2. Separationg versicolor form virginica is much harder to as they have considerable overlap.
